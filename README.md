# HitchHike

Our app prototype of a ride share

We used Facebook to keep each other up to date with what we were doing. We did not use issues trackers, because often we ran into problems with our designated tasks and siwtched task with other members to help each other and to get a new perspective on the problem. We also used pair programming techniques.
